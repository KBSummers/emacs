#+title: VCU Power State Notes

RCS triples don't have the same number of pre-protections before them, because all of the extra valves for the propellant, because the RCS are cold gas, they don't have all those tank protections.

=Range safety requirement= systems which lead to catastrophic failures need to be 2-fault tolerant. So if we have iso-valve, you need 3, so that 2 could fail and we would be good. For critical failures, we need single fault tolerance.
We may want to have the RCS-VCU powered off to meet this requirement. The way it is wired now, we will not get the pressure transducer telemetry for those. We may need to move these pressure transducers.

List of Options:
- Isolation valves will be split in a way that makes sense. 



We control one of the isolation valve on each tree, 

We still need the pressure transducer's to be on during launch. because we need to verify that all of the pressures look good on the pad, and preferably in the air too, but most likely we can't do during flight. 

They need to do a checkout on the RCS before doing "sun pointing". 

WE need nominal power, and power numbers for each box. And we also need these to be thoroughly tested.
