* Application
- prototype device is relatively small, size of dollars, Ethernet port on back.
- Ranging application using radio-location to estimate distance between two devices.
- Based on IEEE 802.15.4.2011 Low-rate WPAN
- Beacons have unique 64-bit IP, operating on UWB Channel 1
- Timing information in packet payload
- App writes out distance in meters to a log file.

* External Interfaces
- Serial Port for Console Access, through USB cable. configuration of radio and network parameters done through terminal through here
- Ethernet switch receiving commands from control system.
- SD Card contains two human readable log files with ranging information and one for system log and diagnostics
- UWB radio creating mesh network with other beacons
- Reset Button
* Software Stack
^ Application
^ FreeRTOS
^ Microcontroller ARM-cortex 4

* Software Arch

* Build Systems
- simple makefile based build, with one top-level makefile
- single ARM executable output
- unique binaries per device generated through build with parameters
- Linux environment/ ARM gcc toolchain

* Hardware
- STM32 microcontroller
* RF / Comms

* Risks
- No watchdog timer, but microcontroller has built in can resolve this
- No EDAC, cannot detect or correct errors in memory
- Memory fragmentation is possible, but typically its days or weeks before these occur and this application will only have a few hours run-time, so very low risk
- WPAN Round-Robin

* Path Forward
- Finish application Layer Software
- V&V testing
- Connect to Xodiac and test ethernet connections, verify readiness for hardware-in-the-loop testing
