* Fault Tolerance

<2022-01-10 Mon>
** Front Parlor
This has been kind of put on hold. This will have automatic detumbling, but is considered
lower priority. At some point GNC will have a detumbling algorithm.
- *Detumbling* consists of damping all angular velocity components of the spacecraft to zero.
** Compute power and memory Needs
Concerns about process times and memory resources. Processor times, is there a total compute
power able to meet the GNC executive's needs? We have dual processors on each GPC, we run two copies on each.

Question for GNC?
- Are you guys close enough to something where you can get an idea of memory and cpu usage for GNC executive, for each 1 Hz, 10 Hz, and 100 Hz loops?
 Answer: not that close, about to begin on work for this and FSW in general.

Processor Capabilites on the GPC:
*P2020 Processor*
- At the Flight software core, we have cFs, we need to get numbers on memory size and performance in order to assess GPC capabilities.
- As we begin to define telemetry definitions, we will build an idea of memory size.

** Valispace Data
- Once we begin to know what we need from telemetry, this will drive the ICD development. At the low level, we talk about values that go along with commands, this will mimic the data types defined in telemetry.
- Translating data from a pdf (confluence) to valispace might require a little more manual work that can introduce many possibilities of errors.
- For a given subsystem, see if we can present data in an easier-to-read way, perhaps a spreadsheet or array. Perhaps this will allow us to translate data easier into Valispace.
- Hancock is a tool that would allow many pairs of eyes to see a file containing values (.csv, spreadsheet, array or whatever we want to get data into Valispace) before posting to single-source of truth. We might want something similar.
- Whats easiest format for comms? want to use excel, manipulate to csv.
- Pair whatever format we use to an easy readable format for us to observe before posting. Allows for easier external review from peers.
- Lets find a tool similar to Hancock or Trac!
^ link to an SVN file, this is what gets reviewed.


- component naming on same-level of tree may cause collision issues
- valispace id mapping to telemetry id? may want this

** Trac

** Comms
- Paul needs to check back with Casey to see how close they are to obtaining the PDU, because we need to discuss more information about data coming in through here. We have a *synclink*, where to can open a putty term send clocked serial data for testing and emulation in the meantime, we can then get the radio up and running and take RF measurements.
- lets write a script to continuously playback a file through this serial ports to begin emulation of radio network.
** GNC
- 1000 montecarlo sims, we would like 997 of them to not fail. 95, and 99.7 % are two and three standard deviations.
- Can we increase the cant angle and have better knowledge of that cant angle. because if that measurement has more certainty, we will have better certainty of other items.
- Try to solve a wide range of problems with a small set of algorithms
- hard to pick an optional gain set, so many options
- range of likely hood that we hit a boulder --- %25 - %75 chance of hitting boulder
** Valispace
- need to add the actual range for data in each component. Define a data_type for ranges. Delta position(might be amount of change in a given cycle time, this would require less precision),, absolute position (might be where we are in meters, well need so many digits to do that) Guess: float --> number of digits for mantissa and range for exponents, for double and floats.
- Tailored set of data types {so we can express things in terms of maximum/minumum} this will make it easier to calculate data size needed.
- Two-level hierarchy of data types: for, instance GNC MAY be the only subsystem that needs data types for velocity, etc.
- As we learn more about other subsystems, we may need to share data types.

** Synclink Testing
- we need to add this loopback test in

** EPS standup needs
-telemtery to say settings of the seitched
-RLCL (basically like breakers) if you pull too much current they power off, but you can reset it and turn it back on
- What are they suppliying us for current information, if an RLCL blows can we tell which current was being pulled through. We can pull again and see what blows?
- Eliminate those and take out RLCL as a point of failure.
- If one of them fails, we've lost the spacecraft.
- If there is a transient failure inRLCL or device its powering such that RLCL gets tripped, we can turn it back on and see.
- Is th eporbability that an RLCL gets a hard failure a lower priority than us having multiple soft failures, because if it gets powered off were screwed.
- Tell me more about the RLCL's work
- We dont know what we can control from FSW really, its conceivable that these things(RLCL) can be turned off like a breaker, is it like an on/off switch.
1. What can we control?
2. How do we control it?
C&DH document is basically a guess.
Solar panels
- are there error conditions we need to handle?
